>Many of us spend a good deal of our time staring at screens from laptops, computers, smartphones, gaming systems and television. This can put a lot of strain on our eyes and cause eye fatigue. When using your screens give your eyes a break.
>Use the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away.
&mdash; Canadian Association of Optometrists

20twenty20 is a Python (2.7) app for Mac to help you follow the 20-20-20 rule by displaying a fullscreen message reminding you to look away from your screen (along with an inspirational quote) every 20 minutes. Comes with status bar controls.

## Install
`pip install pygame rumps schedule`

## Run
`python main.py &`

You can probably wrap this in an Automator script or make a bash alias or... something
